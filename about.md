# About
Harker Hackers is a group of Harker Middle school students dedicated to building serviceable student software, established January 2021. Since then, we have released a variety of projects. We build tools to improve our peer's school life using technology. We hope to soon have some of our services pushed as official school solutions. HH encourages people who love to innovate and serve to join our team!
