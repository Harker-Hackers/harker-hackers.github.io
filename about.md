# About
**Harker Hackers** is a group of Harker Middle School students dedicated to building serviceable student software, established January 2021. Since then, we have released a variety of projects. We build tools to improve our peers' school life using technology, and we've have had our services pushed as official school solutions. We encourage those who love to innovate and serve the community to join our team!

Founded by Aarav Borthakur and Aarush Vailaya.
